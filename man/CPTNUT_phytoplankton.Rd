\title{Phytoplankon data from the chlorpyrifos-nutrient (CPF-NUT) experiment from van den Brink & ter Braak (1998)}
\description{
The dataframe \code{CPTNUT_phytoplankton} contains the design and phytoplankton data from
the microcosm example of PRC from van den Brink & ter Braak (1998). In this experiment from van Donk et al. (1995),
there are three
treatments: control (\code{con}), nutrients (\code{nut}) and nutrients with chlorpyrifos application (\code{cpf-nut}), each with
four cosms (replications) sampled 13 times (twice before nutrients where added and six times before the additional
application of chorpyrifos). The phytoplankton data are counts and 26 species in total.





\itemize{
\item\code{samples} character identifier for the sample.
\item\code{Time} factor coding for the week of sampling with respect to first application of nutrients.
\item\code{Treatment}  treatment factor as in van den Brink & ter Braak (1998).
The levels are \code{con}, \code{nut} and \code{cpf-nut} for the four control cosms,
the four cosms that receive nutrients after the first
two sampling points, and the four cosms to which both nutrients and chorpyrifos are applied, respectively.
Note that the cosms of the nutrient-chlorpyrifos treatment are coded herein as \code{nut} in the weeks
before the first chlorpyrifos application, as they are treated experiment-wise similarly in these weeks. But, note that
the samples from \code{con} and \code{nut} are coded differently on pre-treatment times (although they
are similar experiment-wise),
so as to see the pre-treatment variability. See also the factor \code{con_nut_cpf}.
\item\code{Plot} numeric identifier for the microcosm.
\item\code{con_nut_cpf} treatment factor. Before application of nutrients or
chlorpyrifos, the samples are all treated similarly, but are coded differently (as often in PRC).
\item cell counts of 25 different phytoplankton taxa in 1L and density for the 26th species, Volvox.
For details, see van den Donk et al. (1995).
